Additionally, the accumulation of waste in landfills can attract pests and vermin, which can pose a risk to public health and safety.

Improper waste disposal can lead to littering, contamination of the environment, and even health risks for those who come into contact with the waste. Therefore, it is crucial to educate people on the importance of proper waste management and encourage them to dispose of their waste responsibly.",

Furthermore, improper waste disposal can increase the risk of exposure to hazardous materials, such as chemicals or sharp objects, which can cause harm to people, animals, and the environment.
