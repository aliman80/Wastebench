/home/numansaeed/Desktop/Ali_Bhai/Qwen-VL/waste_dataset/splits_final_deblurred/test/data/08_frame_000311.PNG,Are all the waste materials in the image in a similar state of decomposition?,No,"It is not possible to determine the state of decomposition of the waste materials in the image without further information or closer examination. The appearance of the waste materials may vary depending on the type of material and the conditions in which they are exposed to. Some materials may decompose more rapidly than others, so it is possible that not all the waste materials are in a similar state of decomposition.","{'predicted': 'correct', 'score': 4, 'reason': 'The predicted answer correctly addresses the question by explaining that it is not possible to determine the state of decomposition of the waste materials without further information. It also mentions that the appearance of waste materials can vary depending on the type and conditions, so not all waste materials may be in a similar state of decomposition.'}",correct

They all appear to be in various stages of decay and decomposition, indicating that they are likely all organic waste.","{'predicted': 'incorrect', 'score': 2, 'reason': 'The predicted answer is incorrect as it contradicts the ground truth answer. While the predicted answer acknowledges that the waste materials are in various stages of decay and decomposition, it incorrectly states that they appear to be similar in condition.'}",incorrect
